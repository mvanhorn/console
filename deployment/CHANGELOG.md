## 11.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#7837](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/7837)
  [`c00ea50`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/c00ea5091c4ce9c939f1072876e6ebc4e991b1eb)
  Thanks [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l)! - Improved performance when looking up affected app
  deployments for breaking change detection.

  **BREAKING CHANGE**

  This release introduces a breaking change because it depends on a manual database migration
  introduced in `10.1.0`.

  If you use the app deployments feature for conditional breaking change detection, you should:

  1. Upgrade to `10.1.0`
  2. Perform the manual database migration steps described in that version
  3. Then upgrade to this release

  **Alternative upgrade path**

  If you want to avoid performing the manual database migration:

  1. Upgrade to `10.1.0`
  2. Wait until all app deployments created **before** the rollout of `10.1.0` are retired
  3. Then upgrade to this release

      instead of aggregated field key usage across subgraphs.
    - Avoid emitting redundant `@join__field(external: true)` metadata when a field is only required
      through overridden paths.
    - Tighten `@join__field` emission around @override and interface type fields.

### Major Changes

- [#7705](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/7705)
  [`14c73e5`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/14c73e57513b5b0df8faa2aca8f4a1eb84088b7c)
  Thanks [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l)! - **BREAKING** Remove support for `supertokens`
  service and replace it with native authentication solution.

  ## Upgrade Guide

  Adjust your docker compose file like the following:

  - Remove `services.supertokens` from your `docker-compose.community.yml` file
  - Remove the following environment variables from the `services.server.environment`
    - `SUPERTOKENS_CONNECTION_URI=`
    - `SUPERTOKENS_API_KEY=`
  - Set the following environment variables for `services.server.environment`
    - `SUPERTOKENS_REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY=`
    - `SUPERTOKENS_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=`

  ### Set the refresh token key

  #### Extract from existing `supertokens` deployment

  This method works if you use supertokens before and want to have existing user sessions to
  continue working. If you want to avoid messing with the database, you can also create a new
  refresh token key from scratch, the drawback is that users are forced to login again.

  Extract the refresh token key from the supertokens database

  ```sql
  SELECT
    "value"
  FROM
    "supertokens_key_value"
  WHERE
    "name" = 'refresh_token_key';
  ```

  The key should look similar to this:
  `1000:15e5968d52a9a48921c1c63d88145441a8099b4a44248809a5e1e733411b3eeb80d87a6e10d3390468c222f6a91fef3427f8afc8b91ea1820ab10c7dfd54a268:39f72164821e08edd6ace99f3bd4e387f45fa4221fe3cd80ecfee614850bc5d647ac2fddc14462a00647fff78c22e8d01bc306a91294f5b889a90ba891bf0aa0`

  Update the docker compose `services.server.environment.SUPERTOKENS_REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY` environment
  variable value to this string.

  #### Create from scratch

  Run the following command to create a new refresh key from scratch:

  ```sh
  echo "1000:$(openssl rand -hex 64):$(openssl rand -hex 64)"
  ```

  ### Set the access token key

  Generate a new access token key using the following instructions:

  ```sh
  # 1. Generate a unique key name. 'uuidgen' is great for this.
  #    You can replace this with any string you like, e.g., KEY_NAME="my-app-key-1"
  KEY_NAME=$(uuidgen)
  # 2. Generate a 2048-bit RSA private key in PEM format, held in memory.
  PRIVATE_KEY_PEM=$(openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048)
  # 3. Extract the corresponding public key from the private key, also held in memory.
  PUBLIC_KEY_PEM=$(echo "$PRIVATE_KEY_PEM" | openssl rsa -pubout)
  # 4. Strip the headers/footers and newlines from the private key PEM
  #    to get just the raw Base64 data.
  PRIVATE_KEY_DATA=$(echo "$PRIVATE_KEY_PEM" | awk 'NF {if (NR!=1 && $0!~/-----END/) print}' | tr -d '\n')
  # 5. Do the same for the public key PEM.
  PUBLIC_KEY_DATA=$(echo "$PUBLIC_KEY_PEM" | awk 'NF {if (NR!=1 && $0!~/-----END/) print}' | tr -d '\n')
  # 6. Echo the final formatted string to the console.
  echo "${KEY_NAME}|${PUBLIC_KEY_DATA}|${PRIVATE_KEY_DATA}"
  ```

  Update the docker compose `services.server.environment.SUPERTOKENS_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY` environment
  variable value to the formatted string output.

  ## Conclusion

  After performing this updates you can run Hive Console without the need for the `supertokens`
  service. All the relevant authentication logic resides within the `server` container instead.

  Existing users in the supertokens system will continue to exist when running without the
  `supertokens` service.

  - Fix supergraph `@join__field` generation for `@override` + `@requires` migrations and add a

  - When a field with `@requires` is overridden, composition now ignores `@requires` usage coming
    only from the overridden source field when deciding whether to keep
    `@join__field(..., external: true)`. This prevents stale external annotations in the supergraph.
  - Progressive override (`@override(..., label: ...)`) is now rejected when the overridden source
    field uses `@requires` (error code: `OVERRIDE_COLLISION_WITH_ANOTHER_DIRECTIVE`).
    Non-progressive override behavior is unchanged.

  Thanks [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l)! - Add experimental support for running without
  `supertokens` service.

  ## Instructions

  ### Prerequisites

  Adjust your docker compose file like the following:

  - Remove `services.supertokens` from your `docker-compose.community.yml` file
  - Remove the following environment variables from the `services.server.environment`
    - `SUPERTOKENS_CONNECTION_URI=`
    - `SUPERTOKENS_API_KEY=`
  - Set the following environment variables for `services.server.environment`
    - `SUPERTOKENS_AT_HOME=1`
    - `SUPERTOKENS_REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY=`
    - `SUPERTOKENS_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=`
  - Set the following environment variables for `services.migrations.environment`
    - `SUPERTOKENS_AT_HOME=1`

  ### Set the refresh token key

  #### Extract from existing `supertokens` deployment

  This method works if you use supertokens before and want to have existing user sessions to
  continue working. If you want to avoid messing with the database, you can also create a new
  refresh token key from scratch, the drawback is that users are forced to login again.

  Extract the refresh token key from the supertokens database

  ```sql
  SELECT
    "value"
  FROM
    "supertokens_key_value"
  WHERE
    "name" = 'refresh_token_key';
  ```

  The key should look similar to this:
  `1000:15e5968d52a9a48921c1c63d88145441a8099b4a44248809a5e1e733411b3eeb80d87a6e10d3390468c222f6a91fef3427f8afc8b91ea1820ab10c7dfd54a268:39f72164821e08edd6ace99f3bd4e387f45fa4221fe3cd80ecfee614850bc5d647ac2fddc14462a00647fff78c22e8d01bc306a91294f5b889a90ba891bf0aa0`

  Update the docker compose `services.server.environment.SUPERTOKENS_REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY` environment
  variable value to this string.

  #### Create from scratch

  Run the following command to create a new refresh key from scratch:

  ```sh
  echo "1000:$(openssl rand -hex 64):$(openssl rand -hex 64)"
  ```

  Update the docker compose `services.server.environment.SUPERTOKENS_REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY` environment
  variable value to this string.

  ### Set the access token key

  Generate a new access token key using the following instructions:

  ```sh
  # 1. Generate a unique key name. 'uuidgen' is great for this.
  #    You can replace this with any string you like, e.g., KEY_NAME="my-app-key-1"
  KEY_NAME=$(uuidgen)
  # 2. Generate a 2048-bit RSA private key in PEM format, held in memory.
  PRIVATE_KEY_PEM=$(openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048)
  # 3. Extract the corresponding public key from the private key, also held in memory.
  PUBLIC_KEY_PEM=$(echo "$PRIVATE_KEY_PEM" | openssl rsa -pubout)
  # 4. Strip the headers/footers and newlines from the private key PEM
  #    to get just the raw Base64 data.
  PRIVATE_KEY_DATA=$(echo "$PRIVATE_KEY_PEM" | awk 'NF {if (NR!=1 && $0!~/-----END/) print}' | tr -d '\n')
  # 5. Do the same for the public key PEM.
  PUBLIC_KEY_DATA=$(echo "$PUBLIC_KEY_PEM" | awk 'NF {if (NR!=1 && $0!~/-----END/) print}' | tr -d '\n')
  # 6. Echo the final formatted string to the console.
  echo "${KEY_NAME}|${PUBLIC_KEY_DATA}|${PRIVATE_KEY_DATA}"
  ```

  Update the docker compose `services.server.environment.SUPERTOKENS_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY` environment
  variable value to the formatted string output.

  ## Conclusion

  After performing this updates you can run Hive Console without the need for the `supertokens`
  service. All the relevant authentication logic resides within the `server` container instead.

  Existing users in the supertokens system will continue to exist when running without the
  `supertokens` service.

  Thanks [@jdolle](https://github.com/jdolle)! - We continue to build and expand the features of
  schema proposals. In this change, a background composition job was added to allow asynchronous
  updates to the composition state of a proposal. This composition job uses the schema service's
  composer but is unique from checks in that it takes the latest state of all subgraphs that are a
  part of a schema proposal.

  ### Additional environment variables for `workflows` service:

  The `workflow` service calls the `schema` service's composeAndValidate TRPC endpoint and requires
  the `schema` service endpoint. And the shared instance of Redis, used as a pubsub in the `server`
  and `api` services, is also now used by `workflows` to update
  `Subscription.schemaProposalComposition`.

  For self hosters, make sure to provide the following environment variables to the `workflows`
  service:

  - SCHEMA_ENDPOINT
  - REDIS_HOST
  - REDIS_PORT
  - REDIS_PASSWORD

  comparing with the latest composable version. This has already been the default for new projects
  created after April 2024.

  Federation and schema stitching projects can now publish service schemas to the registry even if
  those schemas would break composition. This has also been the default behavior for new projects
  created after April 2024.

  To ensure every version publishd to the schema registry is composable, we recommend to first check
  the schema against the registry **before** publishing.

- [#7383](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/7383)
  [`ec77725`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/ec77725ca16db22e238b4f3ba3d9c881ffb0cd62)
  Thanks [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l)! - Add a new `workflows` service. This service
  consolidates and replaces the `emails` and `webhooks` services, using a Postgres-backed persistent
  queue for improved stability and reliability.

  If you are running a self-hosted setup the following docker compose changes are required:

  ```diff
  services:

  +  workflows:
  +    image: '${DOCKER_REGISTRY}workflows${DOCKER_TAG}'
  +    networks:
  +      - 'stack'
  +    depends_on:
  +      db:
  +        condition: service_healthy
  +    environment:
  +      NODE_ENV: production
  +      PORT: 3014
  +      POSTGRES_HOST: db
  +      POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
  +      POSTGRES_DB: '${POSTGRES_DB}'
  +      POSTGRES_USER: '${POSTGRES_USER}'
  +      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: '${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}'
  +      EMAIL_FROM: no-reply@graphql-hive.com
  +      EMAIL_PROVIDER: sendmail
  +      LOG_LEVEL: '${LOG_LEVEL:-debug}'
  +      SENTRY: '${SENTRY:-0}'
  +      SENTRY_DSN: '${SENTRY_DSN:-}'
  +      PROMETHEUS_METRICS: '${PROMETHEUS_METRICS:-}'
  +      LOG_JSON: '1'
  -  emails:
  -    ...
  -  webhooks:
  -    ...
  ```

  For different setups, we recommend using this as a reference.

  **Note:** The workflows service will attempt to run postgres migrations for seeding the required
  database tables within the `graphile_worker` namespace. Please make sure the database user has
  sufficient permissions. For more information please refer to the
  [Graphile Worker documentation](https://worker.graphile.org/).

  Thanks [@adambenhassen](https://github.com/adambenhassen)! - Add `activeAppDeployments` GraphQL
  query to find app deployments based on usage criteria.

  New filter options:

  - `lastUsedBefore`: Find stale deployments that were used but not recently (OR with
    neverUsedAndCreatedBefore)
  - `neverUsedAndCreatedBefore`: Find old deployments that have never been used (OR with
    lastUsedBefore)
  - `name`: Filter by app deployment name (case-insensitive partial match, AND with date filters)

  Also adds `createdAt` field to the `AppDeployment` type.

  See
  [Finding Stale App Deployments](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/schema-registry/app-deployments#finding-stale-app-deployments)

  Thanks [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l)! - Fix federation composition access validation on
  union members when selecting `__typename` in `@requires` directives.

  The `@requires` directive validation rule (`AuthOnRequiresRule`) was not checking authorization
  requirements for `__typename` selections on union types. When `__typename` on a union type was
  selected, code would throw an unexpected error.

### Minor Changes

- [#7303](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/7303)
  [`840bc08`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/840bc08236dfd635d720566360b176e1cc59ce70)
  Thanks [@adambenhassen](https://github.com/adambenhassen)! - Add configurable data retention TTL
  for self-hosted Hive instances. Self-hosted users can now configure retention periods via
  environment variables instead of hardcoded values.

  New environment variables:

  - `CLICKHOUSE_TTL_TABLES` - Retention for ClickHouse mergetree tables (Default: 1 YEAR)
  - `CLICKHOUSE_TTL_DAILY_MV_TABLES` - Retention for daily materialized view tables (Default: 1
    YEAR)
  - `CLICKHOUSE_TTL_HOURLY_MV_TABLES` - Retention for hourly materialized view tables (Default: 30
    DAYS)
  - `CLICKHOUSE_TTL_MINUTELY_MV_TABLES` - Retention for minutely materialized view tables (Default:
    24 HOURS)

  Supports both numeric days (e.g., `365`) and ClickHouse interval syntax (e.g., `"1 YEAR"`,
  `"30 DAY"`, `"24 HOUR"`).

  The retention update runs automatically if any retention environment variable is set.

  Thanks [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l)! - Add support for retrieving CDN artifacts by version
  ID.

  New CDN endpoints allow fetching schema artifacts for a specific version:

  - `/artifacts/v1/:targetId/version/:versionId/:artifactType`
  - `/artifacts/v1/:targetId/version/:versionId/contracts/:contractName/:artifactType`

  Artifacts are now written to both the latest path and a versioned path during schema publish,
  enabling retrieval of historical versions.

  CDN artifact responses now include the `x-hive-schema-version-id` header, providing the version ID
  of the schema being served.

  [`f266368`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/f26636891b8b7e00b9a7823e9d584cedd9dd0f2d)
  Thanks [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l)! - Upgrade graphql-inspector/core to v7 and update the
  models to be able to handle the new change objects. GraphQL Inspector now supports directive
  changes and improves the accuracy of the severity level for several change types. This will
  improve schema checks to make them more accurate and more complete. See graphql-inspector's
  changelog for details.

  [`114cd80`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/114cd80a8e419d6ff631631fee28a9922a7b9e5a)

## 8.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#7306](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/7306)
  [`29de664`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/29de664960f3bcbadd3672645ed7fff5126aa012)
  Thanks [@kamilkisiela](https://github.com/kamilkisiela)! - Updated federation-composition to
  v0.21.0

  - **Enhanced auth directive validation**: The federation-composition now enforces correct
    placement of auth directives (`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, `@policy`) by rejecting
    attempts to place them on interfaces, interface fields, or interface objects with the new
    `AUTH_REQUIREMENTS_APPLIED_ON_INTERFACE` validation rule.
  - **Transitive auth requirements checking**: Added a new validation rule that ensures fields using
    `@requires` specify at least the auth requirements of the fields they select. If a field doesn't
    carry forward required auth directives, composition fails with a
    `MISSING_TRANSITIVE_AUTH_REQUIREMENTS` error.
  - **Auth requirements inheritance**: Interface types and fields now properly inherit
    `@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, and `@policy` directives from the object types that
    implement them.
  - **`@cost` directive restrictions**: The `@cost` directive can no longer be placed on interface
    types, their fields, or field arguments. Invalid placements now result in composition errors
    instead of being silently accepted.
  - **Improved `@listSize` validation**: The directive now validates that `sizedFields` point to
    actual list fields rather than integer counters. Additionally, `slicingArguments` validation has
    been added to ensure only arguments that exist in all subgraphs are retained.
  - **Fixed `EXTERNAL_MISSING_ON_BASE` rule**: Resolved false positives when handling
    `@interfaceObject` corner-cases, particularly for `@external` fields on object types provided by
    interface objects.

### Major Changes

- [#6556](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/6556)
  [`7b9129c`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/7b9129cd86d4d76873734426b7044203bb389a2c)
  Thanks [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l)! - Add organization access tokens; a new way to issue
  access tokens for performing actions with the CLI and doing usage reporting.

  **Breaking Change:** The `usage` service now requires environment variables for Postgres
  (`POSTGRES_SSL`, `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`,
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`) and Redis (`REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`,
  `REDIS_TLS_ENABLED`).

  For more information please refer to the organization access token documentation.

  [`0fd4d96`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/0fd4d966ab6f01cd16a5716e1c33363ca5771127)
  Thanks [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l)! - Restructure the environment variables used for the
  Hive Cloud hosting. While this is techincally a breaking change it will not really affect people
  self-hosting Hive.

  **Breaking**: Remove unused environment variable options `HIVE_REPORTING`,
  `HIVE_REPORTING_ENDPOINT` and `HIVE_USAGE_DATA_RETENTION_PURGE_INTERVAL_MINUTES` from the `server`
  service.

  These environment variables are obsolete since the Hive GraphQL schema is reported via the Hive
  CLI instead.

  **Breaking**: Replace the environment variable option `HIVE` with `HIVE_USAGE`, rename environment
  variable option `HIVE_API_TOKEN` to `HIVE_USAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` for the `server` service. Require
  providing the `HIVE_USAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable if `HIVE_USAGE` is set to `1`.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#6231](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/6231)
  [`b7e4052`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/b7e4052ecfd8f70fefe39c27886619a24faa7526)
  Thanks [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l)! - New permission system for organization member
  roles.

  The existing scopes assigned to organization members have been replaced with a permissions-based
  system, enabling more granular access control and role-based access control (RBAC) in Hive.

  **Breaking Changes**

  - **Viewer Role Adjustments** – Members with the default Viewer role can no longer create targets
    or projects.
  - **Restricted Role Management** – Permissions for inviting, removing, and assigning roles have
    been revoked. An admin must manually reassign these permissions where needed.
  - **Expanded Role Assignment** Capabilities – Members with permissions to manage invites, remove
    members, or modify roles can now grant additional permissions without restrictions. Caution is
    advised when assigning these rights, as they should be reserved for "Admin" roles.

  These changes enhance security and provide greater flexibility in managing user permissions across
  organizations.

### Minor Changes

- [#6378](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/6378)
  [`f14daa8`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/f14daa89760149d6b1eb45d5351d73c4376b7418)
  Thanks [@jasonkuhrt](https://github.com/jasonkuhrt)! - You can now set HTTP headers in your
  [Laboratory Preflight Script](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/dashboard/laboratory/preflight-scripts).
  Every time you run a request from Laboratory, your preflight headers, if any, will be merged into
  the request before it is sent.

  You achieve this by interacting with the
  [`Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/headers) instance newly available at
  `lab.request.headers`. For example, this script would would add a `foo` header with the value
  `bar` to every Laboratory request.

  ```ts
  lab.request.headers.set('foo', 'bar')
  ```

  A few notes about how headers are merged:

  1. Unlike static headers, preflight headers do not receive environment variable substitutions on
     their values.
  2. Preflight headers take precedence, overwriting any same-named headers already in the Laboratory
     request.

  Documentation for this new feature is available at
  https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/dashboard/laboratory/preflight-scripts#http-headers.
